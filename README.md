# ThreadServer

A multi threaded web server, serving HTTP 1.1 on _n_ threads using web sockets. Developed using C and only standard libraries.

## Description

This web server was created as a part of the exercises in the course `TDT4186 Operating Systems` at NTNU in Trondheim, Norway.

It supports both JSON and HTML response headers and is able to server multiple incomming requests at once due to its multithreaded capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

- This project was made with POSIX in mind and therefore is only supported for POSIX systems.

### Installing

```
$ git clone git@github.com:MariusArhaug/ThreadServer.git
```

```
$ cd ThreadServer
```

#### Environment variables

To set up environment variables, you need to create a `.env` file in the root directory. Its contents should be like this:

Note: **Key name cannot change, only value**

```bash
PORT=<port>
WEB_PATH=<path to where the webserver should reside>
N_THREADS=<number of threads>
N_BUFFS=<number of buffers>

```

> Note that there should be no space between the equal sign (neither before nor after).

### Executing program

#### Execute yourself without .env variables

Make sure you have `GCC` and `Make` installed on your system and run the following commands

```
$ make
```

> compiles the program into an output file in /bin

```
$ ./bin/mtwwd [www-path] [port] [#threads] [#bufferslots]
```
> Run from binary folder with desired arguments, will not run unless all four have been selected


##### Or run from makefile with .env variables

```
$ make run
```

> compiles as before but also runs the binary with the environment variables defined earlier, if these are not defined this rule will not work.
